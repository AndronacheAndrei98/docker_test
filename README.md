# Docker Debugging Assignment

## Overview
This assignment will help you develop basic Docker debugging skills by identifying and fixing issues in several Dockerfiles and containers. You'll work on simple scenarios that focus on common Docker problems, logs analysis, and basic troubleshooting.

## Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your machine
- Basic understanding of Docker concepts
- Familiarity with command-line operations

## Assignment Structure (3 Days, ~3 hours per day)

### Day 1: Basic Dockerfile Debugging
- Explore five Dockerfiles with common issues
- Fix the issues to make the containers build and run properly
- Document what was wrong and how you fixed it

### Day 2: Container Logs and Troubleshooting
- Run several containers with runtime issues
- Analyze logs to identify problems
- Fix the issues and verify the containers work correctly

### Day 3: Multi-Container Communication
- Debug a simple two-container setup (web + database)
- Fix network communication issues
- Configure proper logging
- Ensure containers can communicate with each other

## Files in this Repository
- `day1/`: Contains problematic Dockerfiles to debug
- `day2/`: Contains containers with runtime issues to debug
- `day3/`: Contains a simple multi-container setup to debug
- `solutions/`: Directory to document your solutions

## How to Complete the Assignment
1. Start with the tasks in the `day1` folder
2. For each task:
   - Read the README in each directory
   - Try to build and run the containers
   - Identify the issues
   - Fix the problems
   - Document your findings and solutions
3. Continue with `day2` and `day3` tasks
4. Submit your solutions in the `solutions` directory
